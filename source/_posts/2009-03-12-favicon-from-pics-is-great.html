<p>I wanted to get a favicon setup for the new Halogen site, and dreaded looking into how to get the .ico plugin for Photoshop working under CS4 and Vista when I discovered <a href="http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/">FavIcon from Pics</a>. Love it! Uploaded my 64x64 PNG Halogen logo and it converted it quickly. It even had some advanced options like enabling transparency!  Bookmarked this for future reference. Maybe now I can get around to getting an icon created for s3a and eventually for Dragonfly!</p>
