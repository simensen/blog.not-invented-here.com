<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> has a guide for <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5468067/hideremove-google-buzz-updates-from-your-gmail-inbox">hiding/removing Google Buzz from our Inbox</a>. A better solution for me was to filter Google Buzz conversations to its own label instead of simply archiving it. This way the comments still stand out from the rest of the Buzz.</p>
<p>They mention this as being optional, but it is really easy to miss!</p>
