<p>Dear Facebook Friends,</p>
<p>I’ve been wondering when and how to do this for a while now but the time has come for me to bite the bullet and clean up what I’m doing on Facebook.</p>
<p><b>For 99% of you – this means that I’m about to de-friend you from my personal account on Facebook.</b></p></blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/02/23/dear-facebook-friends-im-de-friending-most-of-you-its-not-you-its-me/">problogger.net</a></div>
    <p>This is something <a href="http://twitter.com/kirkryyn/status/7762049248">I was considering</a> awhile back but didn't actually get around to actually doing.</p></div>
