<p>Not having a Mac capable of doing software development has seriously hindered my ability to attempt to create legitimate iPhone applications. Titanium makes some big claims and I am tempted to give it a go to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>If it delivers on its promise, being able to build an application that can be used on iPhone, iPad and Android would be pretty great, especially for a sans-Mac programmer.</p>
<p>I am a tad skeptical as to whether or not software like this would actually be useful for anything terribly complicated. But in those cases, I imagine it would make more sense to actually work at the native software level anyway.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, after digging for the FAQ I discovered that this still requires having access to the Apple SDK so this does not actually help anyone build an application on Windows or Linux. This is really too bad.</p>
