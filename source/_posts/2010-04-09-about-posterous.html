I had high hopes for Posterous. And for awhile things were good. But things are slipping. Minor annoyances? Getting harder to ignore. It might be time to head back to Wordpress.<p>Will give it a little more time for features to start flowing but really, it is going to be hard to deal with the performance issues. And something tells me that the way that custom domains via. CNAMEs are handled will not change for a very long time...</p>
