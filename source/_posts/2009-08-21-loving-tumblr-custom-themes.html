<p>I'm really enjoying the way that <a href="http://tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> supports <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/custom_themes">custom HTML themes</a>. I am not sure how easy it would be to expand something like this on a larger scale, but it looks very cool and I can see the power in building something like this out for lite content systems with a finite set of potential bits to put places.</p>
<p>I setup a tumblr blog specifically to house <a href="http://beausketch.tumblr.com/">my sketchbook</a> (the idea to use tumblr for this purpose was <a href="http://www.applegeeks.com/blog/2009/07/09/need-to-draw-more/">inspired by Hawk</a>).</p>
