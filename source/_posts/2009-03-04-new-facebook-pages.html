<p>I spent about an hour tonight looking at the new Facebook Pages revamp. I must say, I am a little disappointed by some things (the loss of fb:wide applications on the main page being top on that list) but one of the newer features has me so excited it may actually overshadow my disappointments: status updates!  Since I jumped on the Facebook bandwagon last year, I had been pretty happy with my choice of Pages over Groups for my various pages (I have pages for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/s3a/43417337128">s3a</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Seattle-WA/Halogen/54070097498?ref=ts">Halogen</a> and the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Seattle-WA/Belltown-Art-Walk/37161991327">Belltown Art Walk</a>) with the exception with one big "but"... that being, how can I actually communicate with my fans?  Send updates, you say? No good! After I sent a few I came to realize that nobody would ever even know I had sent them. I had to look long and hard before I could even locate them myself. Turns out they show up on a tab in your inbox, but do not even show up as a new message notification. As far as I can tell, there is literally no way to be notified that you've received an update from a page short of manually clicking Inbox / Updates... what a drag.  Meanwhile, the people running the groups I had joined were happily sending off emails to everyone in the group while I was stuck shouting into a blackhole.  Status updates may make all of the difference! Now if only I can figure out how to make 'em work... hoping that I'm not going to be seriously let down by this feature because I really want to try and get Facebook to work for me.</p>
