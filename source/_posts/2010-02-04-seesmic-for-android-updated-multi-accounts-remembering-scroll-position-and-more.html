<p>It has been interesting seeing how these third party apps for Twitter have been evolving. With the exception of maybe IM clients, I have rarely moved from app to app so frequently. I realize that part of that has been because I have had to find apps for web, desktop, iPhone and now Android, but still. The turnover and lack of loyalty between updates has been a new experience for me.</p>
<div>I have recently switched to <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a> for my primary desktop client as <a href="http://seesmic.com/seesmic_desktop/">Seesmic Desktop</a> does not support list refresh. However, there seems to be little&nbsp;competition&nbsp;in the Twitter client category on&nbsp;Android. Seesmic, as far as I can tell, is the way to go. And with this update, it becomes far more useful, especially to anyone who manages multiple accounts.<p /> </div>
<div>Here are the main features in this update:</div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse;"> 
</span><ul>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Adding an Extra Large text size option</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Your profile information (avatar, number of following and followers,...) will now be updated automatically</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Changing your Twitter account password will now be handled by the application</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Composer now auto-corrects and auto-capitalize your words and sentences</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Notifications are now cleared when the application is accessed from Launcher</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Easily changing default account from the application's Settings</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Can remove a Twitter account simply by pressing on it</li>
</ul>
