<p>I have been having a lot of issues with web browsing lately. I am not yet sure if it is a problem with my internet connection (if so, I have the same problem with two separate providers, both at home and at the office), if it is a problem with my laptop (I hope not... not looking forward to reinstalling everything again...) or if it is a problem with Chrome.</p>
<p>Every time I try to switch back to FireFox from Chrome, I have an issue with the fact that I've grown so very accustomed to the "open link in new tab" being the first option in the right click menu and in FireFox, it is not. So, I did a quick search today for:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">"open link in new tab" on top firefox</blockquote>
<p>And what do you know? Courtesy of <a href="http://www.chriskite.com/2009/05/27/firefox-open-in-new-tab/">Chris Kite's blog</a>, I found a link for a <a href="http://menueditor.mozdev.org/">FireFox Menu Editor</a> that let's me do exactly what I want. Swap the position of the "open link in" options.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm hoping that FireFox has similar issues because I really have grown so used to Chrome. And I'm afraid of some of the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/08/i-want-to-love-firefox-35-but-it-keeps-crashing-on-me/">other issues</a> I've heard about this newer FireFox.</p>
