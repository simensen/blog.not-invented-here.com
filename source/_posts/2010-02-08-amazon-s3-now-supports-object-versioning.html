    <p>One of the things I like about services like <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> is its ability to transparently keep track of multiple versions of a file. With <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> supporting versioning natively, it seems like S3 buckets could pretty easily become an effective version aware backup solution.</p></div>
