<p>In a couple of <a href="http://not-invented-here.com/2009/01/04/programming-help-rant/">recent</a> <a href="http://not-invented-here.com/2009/01/01/stackoverflow-addiction/">posts</a>, I have hinted at my desire to try and get more involved in some programming communities. On my search, I stumbled upon yet another promising site this evening. <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/">Ohloh</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I am more than just a little too unaware of what is going on in the software industry and I have the feeling that Ohloh is far from a new thing. Still, it is new to me. And I like it.</p>
<p>I spent part of the evening claiming all of the recent projects I've created on Google Code and have been enjoying the statistical stuff it spits out about the various projects. Josh says that this could be a very, very bad thing for me to start playing with. But what does he know?</p>
<p>Oh who am I kidding. He is probably right. If this hits anywhere near as hard as my stackoverflow addiction, it really could have a big impact on my productivity. But seriously, who can resist cool bling?</p>
