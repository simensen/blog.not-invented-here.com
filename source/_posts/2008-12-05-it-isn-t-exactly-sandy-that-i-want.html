<p>Maybe she was close, though. I've been thinking about this quite a bit since I decided to move from <a href="http://iwantsandy.com/">I Want Sandy</a> (will be shut down soon, so link may be broken) to <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a>. Remember the Milk has a bunch of great features. In particular, rtm's Gmail Gadget seems to me to be far superior than their main web interface. The iPhone app ( pro feature ) is a huge bonus, too!  Still, there was something very nice about being able to send a quick email to get things onto my calendar and todo list. Back when Twitter worked with IM, having a more or less realtime chat interface to Sandy via. Google Talk was amazing!  I am going to be putting more thought into this, but I am starting to put together a list of things that would make an ideal app for myself. Maybe there is something out there already that does all of this? Not that I can see...</p>
<ul>
<li>Closer to realtime sync with Google Calendar ( CalDAV? )</li>
<li>IM ( XMPP, Google chat, AIM, Y!M, Messenger )</li>
<li>SMS ( Txting, actual short code to use )</li>
<li>Gadgets (Gmail, Google Calendar, iGoogle, Google Desktop )</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<div>More later...</div>
