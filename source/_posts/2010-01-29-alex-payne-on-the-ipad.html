<h3>On the iPad</h3>
<p>For years, me and thousands of other techies have been wondering what comes after the Personal Computer as we’ve known it. Yesterday, in Apple’s <a href="http://apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a>, we caught a glimpse. If I had to pick one predominant emotion in reaction, it would be “disturbed”.</p>
<p>The iPad is an attractive, thoughtfully designed, deeply cynical thing. It is a digital consumption machine. As <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/27/iPad">Tim Bray</a> and <a href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/01/27/how-a-great-product-can-be-bad-news-apple-ipad-and-the-closed-mac/" title="of Create Digital Music">Peter Kirn</a> have pointed out, it’s a device that does little to enable creativity. As just one component of several in a person’s digital life, perhaps that’s acceptable. It seems clear, though, that the ambitions for the iPad are far greater than being a full-color Kindle.</p>
<p>The tragedy of the iPad is that it truly seems to offer a better model of computing for many people – perhaps the majority of people. Gone are the confusing concepts and metaphors of the last thirty years of computing. Gone is the ability to endlessly <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/357323170/free">tweak and twiddle</a> towards no particular gain. The iPad is simple, straightforward, maintenance-free; everything that’s been proven with the success of the iPhone, but more so.</p>
