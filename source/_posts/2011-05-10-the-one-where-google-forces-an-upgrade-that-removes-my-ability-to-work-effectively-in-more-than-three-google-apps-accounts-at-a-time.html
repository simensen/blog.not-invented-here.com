<p>I fell in love with Google's magical multiple-sign in feature when it was released late last year. It works wonderfully if you have up to three accounts. But what happens when you try to log into your fourth? The nice little message above.</p>
<p>I have one gmail account and at least four Google Apps accounts that I use regularly. When I discovered that upgrading my Google Apps accounts let me do multiple sign-in I was excited. Until I ran into this error. Fortunately I discovered this <em>before</em>&nbsp;I converted my last account.</p>
<p>I've been pinging Google off and on for the last six months on their <a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/request.py?contact_type=multilogin_survey">feature request page</a> letting them know that 3 wasn't enough. (I've seen plenty of other people saying the same thing) I was hoping that they would raise this limit before they force migrated all of the Google Apps accounts. Sadly this did not happen.</p>
<p>My third Google Apps account was finally forced into being upgraded today. In doing so, I'm now no longer able to have this Google Apps account signed in the same time as the other three accounts. My only alternative? Sign out of <strong>all three other accounts</strong> and start over.</p>
<p>Nice, Google. Real nice.</p>
<p>I will not deny that there are many benefits of having Google Apps accounts being treated as first class citizens in many of Google's properties. But the fact that I can no longer be logged into all of my accounts at the same time is a huge inconvenience for me. Beyond inconvenience, actually. It is a productivity killer. A work flow I've had in place for half a year is now completely broken.</p>
<p>The kicker is that this was not a problem <em>yesterday</em>.</p>
<p>What is my recourse? Nothing. Well, I guess I could fill out the feature request page <em>again</em>. I'm not even sure anyone reads those. (they pretty much say as much on the page) I'd consider upgrading a few of my accounts to paid Google Apps accounts if I was convinced it would get my voice heard. Somehow I doubt it would matter.</p>
<p>Thanks for the upgrade that was forced down my throat, Google.</p>
