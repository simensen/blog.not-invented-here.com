<p>Good news for those looking to replace the stock Android browser on your device. The first beta version of <a href="http://phandroid.com/2009/12/17/bring-on-firefox-mobile-for-android/">Firefox for Android</a> (Fennec) will be released in February 2010. <span>Currently, Firefox is among the most popular PC browsers, and my personal favorite. We have seen Fennec operating on the Nokia N900, but now with Firefox for Android the company&rsquo;s plans go even further.</span></p>

<p><span>Mozilla&rsquo;s Fennec browser for Android OS has been in the works for awhile but with its imminent release (beta version), its time to get psyched!</span></p>

<p>I have been using <a href="http://browser.mgeek.mobi/">Dolphin</a> off and on over the last month and I finally reverted back to the stock browser after the most recent update. I will be excited to try out Fennec as the stock Android browser (on Droid and Nexus One, at any rate) leave a lot to be desired.</p>
