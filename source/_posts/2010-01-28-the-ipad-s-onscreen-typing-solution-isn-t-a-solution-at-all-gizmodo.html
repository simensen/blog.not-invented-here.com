    <p>If I had to pick one particular thing that disappointed me the most with the iPad launch today, it would be the fact that it looks like the first release will not have an exciting new multitouch interface to play with.</p><p>I realize that <a href="http://blog.not-invented-here.com/its-not-a-magic-box-it-never-could-be">it's not a magic box</a> but I really had expected something major on this front today to get me as excited about the iPad as I initially was about the iPhone.</p><p>I expect that we will see advancement in the multitouch interface sometime after launch, but how long will we have to wait?</p></div>
