      <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">So, in the end, what it comes down to is that iPad offers new metaphors that will let users engage with their computers with dramatically less friction.  That gives me, as a developer, a sense of power and potency and creativity like no other.  It makes the software market feel wide open again, like no one's hegemony is safe.  How anyone can feel underwhelmed by that is beyond me.</blockquote>
