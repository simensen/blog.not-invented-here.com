<p>Sometime last year I started looking for a way to sync <a href="http://google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> with my <a href="http://apple.com/iphone">iPhone</a>. After a lengthy search, and a few failed and/or hacky solutions, I landed on <a href="http://nuevasync.com/">Nuevasync</a>. As solutions of the time went, Nuevasync was pretty close to perfect. In particular, it did not require any software to be installed on any computers or on the iPhone. It was more or less a Mobile ActiveSync proxy for Google Calendar providing real-time bi-directional syncing with Google Calendar using the iPhone's native Exchange ActiveSync support. &nbsp;And oh yeah, it was free.</p>
<p>I happily used Nuevasync until Google Calendar started to support it's own ActiveSync solution for Google Calendar via. <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/products/sync.html">Google Sync</a>. I actually waited a short while before abandoning the Nuevasync ship, but at some point it felt like it was not really adding any value and was just adding something in the middle that was not required.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I stayed subscribed to the Nuevasync blog.</p>
<p>On July 3rd, Nuevasync gave me a reason to come back to their service with the launch of&nbsp;<a href="http://nuevasync.blogspot.com/2009/07/push-e-mail-is-here.html">push e-mail for <strong>any</strong> IMAP server (including Gmail)</a>. They had finally become a one-stop-shop for sync and push for my iPhone as they finally supported all three services, calendar, contacts and e-mail.</p>
<p>I must say, push <a href="http://gmail.com/">Gmail</a> is amazing. I often get my new email notification on my iPhone before the web client or Google Talk report the new message has arrived. I really couldn't be happier.</p>
<p>I cannot say that the transition was completely without trouble, though. There were some oddities with my specific Gmail account, but the Nuevasync team has been rocking on their (premium) support and everything has stabilized. After a few days of solid use it seems as though it is all good. If they can keep up this level of service and support I will continue to use Nuevasync until Google supports push e-mail support directly. At that point, I'll have to look more closely at the features each support and where Nuevasync will be heading.</p>
<p>It is not clear to me whether or not anyone else will have issues getting their syncs working solidly, so it would be hard for me to really recommend this service to anyone who doesn't enjoy tinkering with their toys for awhile to get them running correctly. The support seems solid, though, and nearly all of the fixes seem to involve deleting the account settings on the iPhone and adding them again so it would probably have minimal impact on ones life to give it a try.</p>
<p>Push email is provided with Nuevasync's <a href="http://forum.nuevasync.com:8080/forum/forums/show/19.page">premium service</a> with a price tag of $25.00/year. Well worth the price, and I'm happy to finally be ale to support Nuevasync financially.</p>
