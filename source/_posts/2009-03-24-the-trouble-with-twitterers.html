<p>I have been spending more time with <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>&nbsp;lately in an effort to stay up to date with friends, art and tech people and to find artists. The experience has been mostly positive, but it has also proven to be frustrating on several levels. Despite the fact that I am now manning three&nbsp;accounts&nbsp;(my own&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/kirkryyn">@kirkryyn</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/s3a">@s3a</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/halogengallery">@halogengallery</a>) I really am on the fence as to how I feel about Twitter's usefulness.  This morning a co-worker sent me a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=7143331">video</a> that pokes fun at the whole Twitter phenomena. Quite amusing (especially the "summoning of the fail whale"). &nbsp;It can be hard to argue how silly Twitter really can be. I mean, who doesn't see nearly all of these parodied tweets at least once a week, if not once a day? Sad to say, I think I have been guilty of some of them myself.  Shortly after watching that video this morning, I see a post from <a href="http://chrislunt.com/">Chris Lunt</a>&nbsp;discussing <a href="http://chrislunt.typepad.com/chris_lunt/2009/03/why-i-stopped-following-you-on-twitter.html">his criteria for unfollowing people on Twitter</a>. And I realize I'm not alone in my desire to determine critera for when and for what reason to stop following people.  You see, I started implementing my own Twitter unfollowing policies this weekend after realizing that a few long time spammy real-life acquaintances and a few new high volume art contacts were not actually following me. Chris inspired me to firm up my criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I know you in person? Have I been following you long enough that you had to have seen my follow request? Are you still not following me? Really? You are extremely active, so I know you're not a n00b. Unfollow.</li>
<li>Are you following more people than follow you? By a factor of 100? I am one of just 50 people following you yet you were uninterested enough in me to not return the follow? Why am I following you again? Unfollow.</li>
<li>Are you extremely active? Are you treating Twitter like a chat client carrying on lengthy or numerous one side chat conversations? &nbsp;And you're not following me? Unfollow.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess what it comes down to is that if I get frustrated with a Twitterer for some reason, whether it be stupid tweets or too many tweets, all I really need to do is look to see whether or not I'm being followed by said Twitterer. If not, it makes the decision very easy. In almost every case since I started to consider mass unfollowing people, it turned out they were not actually following me anyway.</p>
