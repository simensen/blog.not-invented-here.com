<p>I have thought about starting a blog many times over the years. It generally goes a little something like this. "Hey! I should have a blog so I can write down my thoughts about [insert whatever "important" happened that day]." Then I realize that my experiences really are not all that important and clearly nobody else is going to care what I have to say.</p>
<p>Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. Who am I to say? In the end it doesn't really matter. I have decided that this may be a good way for me to keep track of things for myself. Organize my thoughts, help me remember old problems ( or more importantly, the solutions to them ) and just give myself another outlet for all the voices in my head.</p>
<p>Anytime I have seriously thought about my fantasy blog ( before laughing at myself and moving on without one for another few months ), I always figured I'd name it, "Reinventing the Golden Wheel." Sad to say, it seems to sum me up quite nicely. I can justify it in any number of ways for any given project, but deep down inside I sometimes feel a little dirty when I go down that route yet again...</p>
<p>So it was decided. I created a blog! Then the moment I had waited for. Confronted with the, "Blog Title" input field, I suddenly had second thoughts. Years of planning for this moment suddenly seemed moot. Had I really thought through the title? Clearly I want to write about more than just software things! What about people coming to read about art? Are they going to wonder why I named my blog something about golden hammers? Oh! Right, nobody cares... why am I even worrying about my theoretical readers?</p>
<p>After five minutes of thinking and googling for other "cool" names, I decided upon "Not Invented Here." It does a decent job at conveying the same ideas and is a whole lot shorter. So it was a done deal! Yay me.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>Hello world.</p>
